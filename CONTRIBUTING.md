# Commit messages conventions
This project follows the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/it/v1.0.0/) specification.

Steps to follow:

1. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) because we'll use it as our main linter. It's completely plugin-based, you con follow [these instructions](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) to install it onto your machine.

2. Install and configure the [conventional-pre-commit](https://github.com/compilerla/conventional-pre-commit) plugin that allows to use the linter to enforce the usage of conventional commits.   
This repo is already provided with a proper configuration of the plugin, see setup instructions [here](https://github.com/compilerla/conventional-pre-commit?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)
