## Variables

The **Variables** table lists all the columns flagged as `feature` or `ground truth`. That's the reason why we have chosen this name. Each field presents with its own type while the `ground truth` is flagged properly.
For the meaning of the column `Field Type` see the *Hands-On Guide*.

## Output

The **Output** table lists all the columns flagged as `probability` or `prediction` and it has to include all the fields produced by your model. Each field presents with its own type while the `probability` and the `prediction` are flagged properly.
